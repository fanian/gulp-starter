gulp-starter
============

Basic project boilerplate with [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/).

## Getting Started

#### 1. Install Node.js

If you've never used Node.js or `npm` before download and install it from [http://nodejs.org/download/](http://nodejs.org/download/).

#### 2. Install gulp.js:

```sh
$ npm install -g gulp
```

Gulp must be installed globally.You may need to use `sudo` to run the install commands as admin.

#### 3. Install npm dependencies:

**Important:** Make sure you're in the project directory.

```sh
$ npm install
```

This runs through all dependencies listed in `package.json` and downloads them to a `node_modules` folder in your project directory.

#### 4. Run gulp:

```sh
$ gulp
```
